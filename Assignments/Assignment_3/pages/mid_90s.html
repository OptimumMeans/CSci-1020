                <h2>Acting Performance</h2>
                <p>
                    The acting performance of the actors in a movie is a 
                    critical component of the overall experience. The actors 
                    are responsible for bringing the characters to life, 
                    conveying emotions, and driving the story forward. A good performance 
                    requires a combination of natural talent, training, and emotional 
                    authenticity. The actors must also be able to work well together, 
                    building chemistry and delivering convincing dialogue. Great acting 
                    performances can elevate a movie and help to make it more impactful, 
                    memorable, and enjoyable.

                    "Mid90s" is a coming-of-age drama released in 2018, written and directed 
                    by Jonah Hill. The movie focuses on a 13-year-old boy named Stevie who 
                    grows up in a troubled home in Los Angeles and finds solace in a group of 
                    skateboarders he meets at a local skate shop. The acting performances in the
                    movie are central to its success, as the actors bring the characters to life 
                    and help to convey the emotions of the story. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The lead performance by Sunny Suljic as Stevie is standout, capturing the 
                    confusion, curiosity, and vulnerability of a young teenager. Suljic conveys 
                    Stevie's journey from a timid and shy child to a confident and independent 
                    young man with great nuance and authenticity. The supporting cast, including 
                    Lucas Hedges, Na-kel Smith, Olan Prenatt, and Gio Galicia, are also excellent, 
                    creating a group of characters that are both likable and memorable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The acting performances in "Mid90s" are essential to creating the sense of 
                    place and time in the movie. The actors are able to capture the spirit of 1990s 
                    Los Angeles, creating a world that feels both nostalgic and timeless. Their 
                    performances are also key to creating the sense of camaraderie and belonging 
                    that is central to the story, making the audience feel invested in the 
                    relationships and emotions of the characters. The combination of strong acting 
                    performances, authentic dialogue, and well-drawn characters makes "Mid90s" a 
                    movie that is both entertaining and emotionally impactful.

                    After purchasing Knowhere from the Collector, the Guardians 
                    of the Galaxy attempt to make it a safe haven for alien 
                    refugees. But after a brutal attack, Peter Quill must lead 
                    the Guardians on one last dangerous mission to protect

                    In April 2017, Gunn felt the music for the film would be 
                    different from what was used for the first two films' 
                    soundtracks, Awesome Mix Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. 
                    The next month, he added that he was "panicking" about 
                    the soundtrack and had to make some "pretty specific choices" 
                    shortly due to the wider range of available music for the 
                    story, By early July 2017, Gunn had narrowed down his choices 
                    for potential songs to 181, but noted that this list could 
                    grow again. All of the songs for the film had been selected 
                    by the following month; the songs are not modern and come 
                    from Quill's Zune that he received at the end of Vol. 2, 
                    although Gunn added that the soundtrack was not limited to 
                    1970s pop songs compared to the first two films. Gunn was unable 
                    to use a song he wanted for Vol. 3 due to a legal battle over 
                    its ownership.
