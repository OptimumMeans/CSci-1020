        <h2>Why I chose Comp-Sci</h2>
        <p>
            I have always been interested in electronics but more specifically,
            computers. Mix that with a love for continous learning and you get
            someone who may or may not choose to pursue a Comp-Sci degree.
            Obviously in my case I chose to pursue it, but it did take me awhile.
            I graduated the year of 2020 and it is now 2023, so roughly 2 years it
            took for me to decide if Computer Science was for me. I think I made
            the right choice! My Teacher Mr. Gorill is very knowledgable and has taught
            me already that the learning don't stop!

        <h2>Headings!</h2>
        <p>
            Headings and sub-headings, as well as sub-sub-headings are very important in the
            HTML hierarchy. They enable many 'Accessability' functions that a user may need, 
            or they can be found at the footer of a site to save countless link-clicking and scrolling.
            Headings run 1-6, with 1 being the biggest (refer to "Camerons First Blog").
            On this page I have only used h1 and h2, h6 is hilariously small. Never use more than 1 h1 tag! Ever!

        <h2>Paragraph tags</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is the basis of this blog. It enables written words rather than
            each word being tried as a command/element/tag. The tag is especially useful when equipped with an 
            <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag, the two go hand-in-hand. It enables blocks of text that can be 
            separated from other blocks of text, such as this blog and its multiple posts. I think the 
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is my favorite. It has enabled me to convey this to you.

        <h2>Tags and Elements</h2>
        <p>
            A tag can be used to open or close an element. 
            An opening tag consists of <code>&lt; and &gt;</code>,
            While a closing tag goes like this: <code>&lt;/ and &gt;</code>.
            An element consists of a command that lets the computer understand
            what you are trying to display, whether it be a paragraph, or a sub-heading.
            Fun fact: I had to learn how to use the greater than and less than sign in
            HTML as those characters are specifically reserved for HTML.

        <h2>Semantics</h2>
        <p>
            There are non-semantic and semantic elements. Non-semantic tells you absolutely
            nothing about the content enclosed. Semantic on the other hand defines the content
            and works for tags such as <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>,
            and <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>. Semantic elements are of high importance to Search Engines
            and the users devices who are perusing your website. It also has greater
            accessability for users who may be blind or have other impairments that require such
            levels of accessability.

        <h2>CSS!</h2>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets, better known by its abbrievation as 'CSS' is a language
            that is primarily used to orient a site. Whether that be the layout, colors, or 
            fonts, it is all controlled via CSS. My website's colors come from CSS, as well as
            the fonts and pixel size. So much can be done. One thing to worry about though, is
            the Hierarchy associated with CSS.

        <h2>The Power of Google</h2>
        <p>
            So to end my last blog post here, I want to talk about Google and how its enabled
            me, persuaded me, and coddled me, as I've been on this journey. I have prior experience
            coding via <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a>, which gave
            me quite a head start on these classes and I enjoy that. Thanks Google! Google has also helped
            me when I've felt helpless on this journey, its allowed for me to ask open-ended questions because I cannot phrase
            the question properly. It has left me feeling like I am unstoppable in this realm. I am
            not re-inventing the wheel, I am simply learning how to code. Google is your friend, do not be ashamed
            to use Google!
