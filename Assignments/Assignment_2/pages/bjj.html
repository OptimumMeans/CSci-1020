            <h2>
                The Origins of Brazilian Jiu-Jistu
            </h2>
            <p>
                Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art and combat sport that originated in Brazil in the 
                early 20th century. It is a derivative of Judo, which was brought to Brazil by Mitsuyo Maeda, 
                a Japanese judoka and member of the Kodokan. In 1914, Maeda began teaching a young Brazilian named 
                Carlos Gracie the art of judo. Carlos Gracie, along with his brother Helio Gracie, began modifying 
                and adapting the techniques of judo to create a new style of grappling that focused on leverage 
                and ground fighting.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Gracie brothers opened the first Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academy in Brazil in 1925 and began 
                teaching the new style of grappling to others. Over the next few decades, the Gracie family continued to 
                develop and refine the techniques of BJJ, and the style began to gain popularity in Brazil and around the 
                world. In the early 1990s, BJJ began to gain international recognition as a combat sport, and in 1993 the 
                first Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu World Championship was held. Since then, BJJ has grown to become one of the most 
                popular and widely practiced martial arts in the world, with millions of practitioners worldwide.

            <h2>
                The true origins
            </h2>

            <p>
                Japanese jiu-jitsu, also known as Jujutsu or simply Jiu-jitsu, is a traditional Japanese martial art 
                that has a long and rich history dating back to the feudal era of Japan. It is a form of grappling that 
                utilizes strikes, throws, joint locks, and chokes to defeat an opponent. The origins of jiu-jitsu can be 
                traced back to the samurai warriors of ancient Japan, who used the art to complement their sword fighting skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the Edo period (1603-1868), the samurai class was disbanded by the government and many samurai 
                found themselves without a purpose or means of support. Some of these former warriors began to teach 
                their fighting skills to the public, leading to the development of various schools or ryu of jiu-jitsu. 
                Each school had its own unique techniques and philosophies, but they all focused on close-quarters combat 
                and the use of leverage to defeat a larger or stronger opponent.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, jiu-jitsu began to be introduced to the Western world by 
                Japanese immigrants and visiting martial artists. One of the most notable figures in this process 
                was Jigoro Kano, who founded the Kodokan school of jiu-jitsu in 1882. Kano made several modifications 
                to the traditional techniques of jiu-jitsu, emphasizing sport and competition over combat effectiveness. 
                He also introduced the ranking system of colored belts, which is still used in jiu-jitsu today.
            </p>

            <p>
                After World War II, jiu-jitsu experienced a resurgence in popularity in Japan and around the world. 
                Many jiu-jitsu practitioners began to incorporate techniques from other martial arts, such as judo and 
                karate, leading to the development of modern mixed martial arts. Today, jiu-jitsu is widely practiced as 
                a sport, self-defense system, and form of physical fitness, and it continues to evolve and adapt to the 
                changing times.

            <h3>
                The transformation
            </h3>

            <p>
                Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a derivative of traditional Japanese jiu-jitsu, which was brought to 
                Brazil in the early 20th century by Mitsuyo Maeda, a Japanese judoka and member of the Kodokan. 
                Maeda, also known as Count Koma, was sent to Brazil by the Japanese government as part of a 
                diplomatic mission to promote the country and its martial arts. In 1914, Maeda began teaching a young 
                Brazilian named Carlos Gracie the art of judo, which was a modified version of jiu-jitsu.
            </p>

            <p>
                Carlos Gracie, along with his brother Helio Gracie, began modifying and adapting the techniques of judo 
                to create a new style of grappling that focused on leverage and ground fighting. The Gracie brothers' 
                style of jiu-jitsu emphasized the use of technique and strategy over brute strength, making it 
                accessible to people of all sizes and abilities. They opened the first Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academy in 
                Brazil in 1925 and began teaching the new style of grappling to others.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the next few decades, the Gracie family continued to develop and refine the techniques of BJJ, 
                and the style began to gain popularity in Brazil and around the world. The Gracie family organized and 
                held the first vale tudo (no-holds-barred) matches in Brazil, which helped to popularize the style and 
                prove its effectiveness in real-world combat.
            </p>

            <p>
                BJJ also began to be introduced to the United States and other countries in the 1980s by the Gracie family 
                and their students, who had immigrated and began to teach the art. BJJ also experienced a resurgence in 
                popularity in the 1990s, when it became one of the key elements in the development of modern mixed martial 
                arts (MMA). BJJ's focus on ground fighting and submissions made it an important addition to the striking-based 
                arts already present in MMA, and it quickly gained a reputation for being one of the most effective styles 
                for self-defense and sport.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, BJJ is widely practiced as a sport, self-defense system, and form of physical fitness, 
                and it continues to evolve and adapt to the changing times. It has many variations, but the main 
                principles of leverage, ground fighting and submissions are always present. It also has a strong 
                competition scene and a ranking system similar to traditional jiu-jitsu.
