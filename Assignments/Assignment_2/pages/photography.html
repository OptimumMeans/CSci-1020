                The Sunny 16 rule is a photographic guideline that states that on 
                a sunny day, when the ISO is set to 100 and the shutter speed is 
                at its reciprocal value of the ISO (1/100th of a second), the aperture 
                should be set to f/16. This will give a proper exposure for a scene 
                that is lit by the sun. It is a simple and easy way to determine the 
                correct exposure settings for outdoor photography without the need for 
                a light meter. However, it is important to note that this rule is only a 
                rough estimate and may not work in all lighting conditions. It is always 
                a good idea to check the exposure with a light meter or by taking a test 
                shot and adjusting as needed.

                Photography is a versatile medium that is used in a wide range of applications 
                in the real world. It is used in art, journalism, advertising, scientific 
                research, and many other fields. In art, photographers use their skills to 
                create visually compelling images that can be used for fine art, commercial 
                art, or social commentary. In journalism, photographers capture images that 
                tell the story of important events and issues around the world. In advertising, 
                photographers use their skills to create eye-catching images that help to sell 
                products and services. Photography also plays a vital role in scientific 
                research, as it is used to document and study everything from the tiniest 
                microorganisms to the largest galaxies. Additionally, it is commonly used 
                in the field of documentation and archiving, such as in the field of 
                archaeology and architectural documentation. Photography is an essential 
                tool for capturing and preserving the world around us, and its uses are continually 
                expanding as technology advances.
