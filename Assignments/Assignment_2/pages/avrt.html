                Introduction
            </h2>

            <p>
                Super Ventricular Tachycardia (SVT) is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that originates 
                in the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart. This condition is characterized by an 
                abnormally fast heart rate, typically over 100 beats per minute, and can be caused by a 
                variety of underlying conditions such as structural heart disease, heart valve problems, or 
                certain medications. SVT can cause symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, shortness of 
                breath, and lightheadedness. In some cases, it can lead to more serious complications such as 
                fainting or cardiac arrest. SVT can be diagnosed by performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
                may be treated with medications, catheter ablation, or surgery, depending on the underlying 
                cause and the severity of the condition. It is important for individuals who experience symptoms 
                of SVT to seek medical attention as soon as possible to determine the cause of the arrhythmia 
                and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.

                Types of SVT
            </h3>

            <p>
                There are four main types of Super Ventricular Tachycardia (SVT), each of which has a 
                unique set of causes and treatment options.
                <ol>
                    <li>Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib-RVR) occurs when the 
                        upper chambers of the heart (atria) beat rapidly and irregularly, and the 
                        electrical signals are transmitted to the ventricles, causing them to beat 
                        rapidly as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is caused by a problem with the 
                        electrical pathways in the heart and is one of the most common types of SVT.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) is caused by an extra electrical 
                        pathway in the heart and is typically seen in people with structural heart disease.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a serious type of SVT caused by abnormal electrical activity 
                        in the ventricles and can lead to sudden cardiac death if not treated promptly.
                        It's important to note that each type of SVT has a different set of causes and treatment options and proper diagnosis is important for the best treatment plan.

                Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia
            </h3>
            <p>
                AVRT can cause symptoms such as palpitations, 
                chest pain, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness. These symptoms can range from mild 
                to severe and can be triggered by physical activity or emotional stress. If left untreated, AVRT 
                can lead to more serious complications such as fainting or cardiac arrest, and can increase the 
                risk of developing heart failure or other cardiac problems.

            <h4>
                My story with AVRT
            </h4>
            <p>
                I was diagnosed with SVT in August '22 after wearing a Holter Monitor for a week before I was due to fly across 
                the world to Europe -- Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands.<br></br> It was quite daunting to begin with, and my 
                anxiety only grew over time. I had never faced something so scary. Genetics are at play here, but I'm afraid it 
                ends there for research. It is relatively unknown to heart doctors, a heavily debated topic in academia. I chose 
                to go the surgery route, and proceeded with getting a Catheter Ablation.

            <h4>
                Catheter Ablation
            </h4>
            
            <p>
                Catheter ablation is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat AVRT (Atrioventricular reentrant 
                tachycardia), which is a type of SVT (Superventricular Tachycardia) caused by an extra electrical 
                pathway in the heart. During the procedure, a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) is inserted through 
                a vein in the leg and guided to the heart. Once in place, the catheter delivers radiofrequency energy 
                or cryotherapy to the specific area of the heart that is causing the abnormal electrical activity. This 
                destroys or alters the tissue and blocks the extra electrical pathway, interrupting the abnormal heart 
                rhythm and restoring a normal heart rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                The procedure is typically performed under conscious sedation and takes several hours to complete. 
                It is typically performed on an outpatient basis and patients can return to normal activities within a week. 
                The success rate of catheter ablation for AVRT is generally high, with studies reporting success rates of 
                up to 98%. However, it's important to note that there are some risks associated with the procedure such as 
                bleeding, infection, and damage to the heart or blood vessels. Catheter ablation is not suitable for all 
                patients and the best treatment option should be discussed with the cardiologist.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the catheter ablation surgery for AVRT, patients will typically spend a few hours in the recovery 
                room before being discharged. They will be given instructions on how to care for the catheter insertion 
                site, and will be advised to avoid strenuous activities for a few days. They may also be given medication 
                to manage pain and to prevent infection.
            </p>

            <p>
                Patients will typically follow up with their cardiologist a week after the procedure to ensure that the 
                ablation was successful and that there are no complications. It's important to note that it's common for 
                patients to experience mild discomfort or a feeling of tightness at the catheter insertion site for a few 
                days post-surgery. They will also be given instructions on how to manage their medications and will be 
                advised on lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise to maintain a healthy heart.
            </p>

            <p>
                Patients will also be advised to avoid any triggers that may have caused their AVRT symptoms before the 
                surgery. They will also be advised to return for regular follow-up appointments with their cardiologist 
                to monitor their heart rhythm and to ensure that the ablation was successful.
