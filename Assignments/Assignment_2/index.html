        <h2>Why I chose Comp-Sci</h2>
        <p>
            I have always been interested in electronics but more specifically,
            computers. Mix that with a love for continous learning and you get
            someone who may or may not choose to pursue a Comp-Sci degree.
            Obviously in my case I chose to pursue it, but it did take me awhile.
            I graduated the year of 2020 and it is now 2023, so roughly 2 years it
            took for me to decide if Computer Science was for me. I think I made
            the right choice! My Teacher Mr. Gorill is very knowledgable and has taught
            me already that the learning don't stop!

        <h2>Headings!</h2>
        <p>
            Headings and sub-headings, as well as sub-sub-headings are very important in the
            HTML hierarchy. They enable many 'Accessability' functions that a user may need, 
            or they can be found at the footer of a site to save countless link-clicking and scrolling.
            Headings run 1-6, with 1 being the biggest (refer to "Camerons First Blog").
            On this page I have only used h1 and h2, h6 is hilariously small. Never use more than 1 h1 tag! Ever!

        <h2>Paragraph tags</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is the basis of this blog. It enables written words rather than
            each word being tried as a command/element/tag. The tag is especially useful when equipped with an 
            <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag, the two go hand-in-hand. It enables blocks of text that can be 
            separated from other blocks of text, such as this blog and its multiple posts. I think the 
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is my favorite. It has enabled me to convey this to you.

        <h2>Tags and Elements</h2>
        <p>
            A tag can be used to open or close an element. 
            An opening tag consists of <code>&lt; and &gt;</code>,
            While a closing tag goes like this: <code>&lt;/ and &gt;</code>.
            An element consists of a command that lets the computer understand
            what you are trying to display, whether it be a paragraph, or a sub-heading.
            Fun fact: I had to learn how to use the greater than and less than sign in
            HTML as those characters are specifically reserved for HTML.

        <h2>Semantics</h2>
        <p>
            There are non-semantic and semantic elements. Non-semantic tells you absolutely
            nothing about the content enclosed. Semantic on the other hand defines the content
            and works for tags such as <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>,
            and <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>. Semantic elements are of high importance to Search Engines
            and the users devices who are perusing your website. It also has greater
            accessability for users who may be blind or have other impairments that require such
            levels of accessability.

        <h2>CSS!</h2>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets, better known by its abbrievation as 'CSS' is a language
            that is primarily used to orient a site. Whether that be the layout, colors, or 
            fonts, it is all controlled via CSS. My website's colors come from CSS, as well as
            the fonts and pixel size. So much can be done. One thing to worry about though, is
            the Hierarchy associated with CSS.

        <h2>The Power of Google</h2>
        <p>
            So to end my last blog post here, I want to talk about Google and how its enabled
            me, persuaded me, and coddled me, as I've been on this journey. I have prior experience
            coding via <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a>, which gave
            me quite a head start on these classes and I enjoy that. Thanks Google! Google has also helped
            me when I've felt helpless on this journey, its allowed for me to ask open-ended questions because I cannot phrase
            the question properly. It has left me feeling like I am unstoppable in this realm. I am
            not re-inventing the wheel, I am simply learning how to code. Google is your friend, do not be ashamed
            to use Google!

<!-- 1. Make a 5 page website. We made a basic 5 page website in the beginning of the lesson. You might use
those pages that we have already created and build upon them.
2. Each page must have a link to all other pages. e.g page 1 will link to pages 2, 3, 4, and 5; page 2 will link to
pages 1, 3, 4, and 5 etc. . .
3. Each page must have content from a different topic. Page 1 might be an introduction to who you are,
page 2 might be about gardening, page 3 might be about rock climbing, and so forth. Pick topics that are
of interest to you.
    A. You may copy and paste text content from the web. It does not have to be original content. We
will not publish these pages online so don't worry about copyright.
    B. You must have a header, nav, content and footer.
    C. you will use articles with h2 headings for your content
    D. you will control whitespace to make a nice looking design
    E. You will control color of backgrounds and text to make a nice looking design
4. You must use font properties in css that we have used in the past: font-family, font-size, color,
font-weight. You must use Google fonts.
5. nav will contain the links to all pages in your website
    a. You must put the nav links in li tags inside a ul.
5. You must use Figure and figcaption in your website. You may place an image or table inside of the figure.
6. You must include at least one of each of the following:
    A. table that uses a colspan for the heading of the table. (You will have to look this up and teach
yourself.)
    B. ordered list
    C. unordered list
    D. image
7. You will post the assignment to the dropbox when done in a zipped format.
    A. you will create a folder that will contain all of your pages and images
    B. you will use winzip or some other utility to zip that folder
    C. you will post the zipped folder to the dropbox.
8. If you want to impress me, go above and beyond these expectations. You could try to make the
navigation in the style of some of the tutorials from MaxDesign's Listmatic site. You could try to figure out
how to use GIMP to crop a photo to fit into your header so that you will have a banner.
    A. GIMP (The GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a free software raster graphics editor. It is
primarily employed as an image retouching and editing tool,[3] in addition to offering freeform
drawing and retouching tools, the GIMP can accomplish essential image workflow steps such as
resizing, editing, and cropping photos, combining multiple images, and converting between
different image formats. GIMP can also be used to create basic animated images in
the GIF format. (citation)
