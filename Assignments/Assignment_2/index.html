1. Make a 5 page website. We made a basic 5 page website in the beginning of the lesson. You might use
those pages that we have already created and build upon them.
2. Each page must have a link to all other pages. e.g page 1 will link to pages 2, 3, 4, and 5; page 2 will link to
pages 1, 3, 4, and 5 etc. . .
3. Each page must have content from a different topic. Page 1 might be an introduction to who you are,
page 2 might be about gardening, page 3 might be about rock climbing, and so forth. Pick topics that are
of interest to you.
    A. You may copy and paste text content from the web. It does not have to be original content. We
will not publish these pages online so don't worry about copyright.
    B. You must have a header, nav, content and footer.
    C. you will use articles with h2 headings for your content
    D. you will control whitespace to make a nice looking design
    E. You will control color of backgrounds and text to make a nice looking design
4. You must use font properties in css that we have used in the past: font-family, font-size, color,
font-weight. You must use Google fonts.
5. nav will contain the links to all pages in your website
    a. You must put the nav links in li tags inside a ul.
5. You must use Figure and figcaption in your website. You may place an image or table inside of the figure.
6. You must include at least one of each of the following:
    A. table that uses a colspan for the heading of the table. (You will have to look this up and teach
yourself.)
    B. ordered list
    C. unordered list
    D. image
7. You will post the assignment to the dropbox when done in a zipped format.
    A. you will create a folder that will contain all of your pages and images
    B. you will use winzip or some other utility to zip that folder
    C. you will post the zipped folder to the dropbox.
8. If you want to impress me, go above and beyond these expectations. You could try to make the
navigation in the style of some of the tutorials from MaxDesign's Listmatic site. You could try to figure out
how to use GIMP to crop a photo to fit into your header so that you will have a banner.
    A. GIMP (The GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a free software raster graphics editor. It is
primarily employed as an image retouching and editing tool,[3] in addition to offering freeform
drawing and retouching tools, the GIMP can accomplish essential image workflow steps such as
resizing, editing, and cropping photos, combining multiple images, and converting between
different image formats. GIMP can also be used to create basic animated images in
the GIF format. (citation)
